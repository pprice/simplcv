I'm from England, graduated from University of Hull in 2005 and worked for 10 years in software. I proudly worked on Visual Studio.

I express myself creatively through illustration and code. I frequently lose myself in making stuff. My perfect Sunday consists of beers, football, hanging out and making something cool.

The most important lesson I've learned is to be patient and I'm inspired by people who care for others. I dream of a world where everyone respects the differences in each other.

I live in Seattle with my wife, and the next door neighbours cat, Charlie.
